Zoomer2 - I would like an application that changes the zoom level of other Mac applications based on the monitor's resolution. The zoom level would adjust dynamically if applications are moved from one monitor to another or if the resolution of a monitor changes. The application uses the CTRL+[+/-] key combination to change the zoom level. The current monitor setup is initialized by a script called check_resolutions.sh (exists), which saves the resolutions to monitor_resolutions.conf (exists). The zoom levels of each app are saved as relative percentages of the base resolution, in the format [app] [res] [zoomlevel]. The base monitor resolution is stored in base_resolution.conf - If an app is on a screen with this resolution, then it's zoom level is considered "100%". Any changes to the zoom level of that app will become the new 100% for that app and invalidate any other existing zoom data for that application. Zoom levels are initialized by monitoring the CTRL+[+/-] key combination. Any manual changes to the zoom level on any screen will initialize the previous zoom level as the "base" level if no base existed and set the new zoom level as the new base value for that screen resolution. The application will run in the background and monitor for changes in the active application and the resolution of the monitor. If the active application changes, the zoom level will be adjusted based on the new application and the resolution of the monitor. If the resolution of the monitor changes, the zoom level will be adjusted based on the new resolution and the active application.
